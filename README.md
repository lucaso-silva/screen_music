# Screen Music

Screen Music is a back-end application developed in **Java with Spring Boot**, designed to manage artists and their songs. The project focuses on **clean domain modeling, data persistence using JPA**, and the application of **best practices in back-end development.**

It also **integrates with an external AI service** to enrich artist data by retrieving additional contextual information, demonstrating the use of third-party APIs within a Spring-based architecture.

This project was developed as part of the Alura course Java: Data Persistence and JPA, with an emphasis on real-world backend development concepts.

## Features
- Create and retrieve artists
- Create and retrieve songs associated with artists
- Entity relationships (Artist ↔ Songs)

- Data persistence using JPA/Hibernate

## Technologies
- Java 21
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- Hibernate
- PostgreSQL

- Maven

## Running the Project
1.	Clone the repository
2.	Configure environment variables (database and AI API key)
3.	Run the application using Maven or Docker

## Key Learnings
- Domain modeling and ORM mapping with JPA/Hibernate
- Code organization following software engineering best practices
- Integrating external services in Java applications
